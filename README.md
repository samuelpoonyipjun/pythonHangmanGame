At the start of the game, there is a prompt for a new word to add into the wordlist.

If the word is already present in the word list, a prompt will be shown, and the new word is still not added into the wordlist.

Regardless of whether the word is present, the logo "hangman" will show and a word to guess will be generated, the user can start guessing.

When the user successfully guesses the word, a message saying "you win" will be shown.

On the other hand, if the word is not present in the wordlist, a message showing that the word is added will be shown.

When the user fails to guess the word before the full man is drawn out, he loses. 

The player has 9 lives so once when he guesses the wrong letter 9 times, he loses and the word will be revealed.
